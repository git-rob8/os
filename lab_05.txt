USE COMMANDS WITH ONLY EXAMPLE AS THEY WORK IN TERMINAL

Process Management

`ps`
Description: The `ps` command stands for "Process Status" and is used to display information about the currently running processes on a Linux system. It shows the process ID (PID), terminal associated with the process, CPU and memory usage, and more.
Usage: `ps [options]`
Exammple: ps

`pstree`
Description: The `pstree` command displays running processes in a tree-like format, showing the hierarchy of parent-child relationships between processes. It offers a more visual and organized way to view process information.
Usage: `pstree [options]`
Exammple: pstree

`nice`
Description: The `nice` command modifies the scheduling priority of a process, allowing users to adjust the CPU time allocated to a process. A higher priority value gives the process more CPU time.
Usage: `nice [options] command`

`kill`
Description: The `kill` command is used to terminate processes by sending signals to them. The default signal is `SIGTERM`, but other signals like `SIGKILL` can also be specified to forcefully terminate a process.
Usage: `kill [signal] PID`
Example: 
ps
kill -SIGTERM <PID of bash>
kill -SIGKILL <PID of bash>

`pkill`
Description: The `pkill` command sends signals to processes based on specific criteria such as process name, user, or other attributes, allowing for the selective termination of processes.
Usage: `pkill [options] pattern`

`killall`
Description: The `killall` command terminates processes by name rather than PID. It sends a signal to all processes running a specified command or program.
Usage: `killall [options] process_name`

`xkill`
Description: The `xkill` command is used in X Window System environments to forcibly terminate a client application by closing its connection to the X server. It provides a quick way to kill unresponsive or problematic GUI applications.
Usage: `xkill`

Job Control

`fg`
Description: The `fg` command brings a background process to the foreground in the current shell session, allowing you to interact with it directly.
Usage: `fg [job_spec]`
Example: 
ping www.google.com
'ctrl+z' to stop
jobs -l
fg %1

`bg`
Description: The `bg` command resumes suspended jobs by running them in the background, freeing up the terminal for other tasks while the job continues to execute.
Usage: `bg [job_spec]`
Example: 
ping www.google.com
'ctrl+z' to stop
bg %1

`pgrep`
Description: The `pgrep` command searches for processes based on specified criteria such as process name or attributes. It is commonly used in combination with `pkill` to select processes for termination.
Usage: `pgrep [options] pattern`
Example:
ps -f
pgrep ps -f

Process Scheduling

`renice`
Description: The `renice` command allows users to change the scheduling priority of a running process. It can increase or decrease the priority value, affecting the CPU time allocated to the process.
Usage: `renice [options] priority PID`
Example:
sudo renice -14 2002
